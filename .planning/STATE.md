# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Visitors feel the quality and aesthetic of Joyce's work through the site itself — every scroll, reveal, and interaction communicates premium visual storytelling before they've seen a single photo.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.07 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 1/2 | 4 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 4 min
- Trend: baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Setup]: Use `motion` v12 with `"motion/react"` imports — NOT `framer-motion`
- [Setup]: Tailwind CSS v3.4 required — v4 breaks `next/font` CSS variable integration
- [Setup]: Switzer must be self-hosted via `next/font/local` — Fontshare CDN incompatible with `next/font`
- [Setup]: All video assets hosted externally (Vercel Blob or Cloudinary) — no video files committed to git
- [01-01]: next.config kept as .mjs (scaffold default) — functionally equivalent to .ts
- [01-01]: autoprefixer added to postcss.config.mjs — omitted by create-next-app scaffold
- [01-01]: Scaffolded in temp dir due to Fotógrafo directory name having non-URL chars

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 1]: Real photo and video assets not yet available — v1 ships with placeholders; cinematic feel cannot be fully evaluated until Joyce provides assets
- [Pre-Phase 6]: Email service for contact form not yet decided — Formspree (no backend) vs. Resend (serverless route.ts); decide before starting Phase 6
- [Phase 5]: `useScroll` production offset bug requires `layoutEffect: false` and local production build verification as mandatory step
